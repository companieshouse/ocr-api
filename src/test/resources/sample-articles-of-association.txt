DIRECTORS
DIRECTORS' POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
3 Directors' general authority
Subject to the articles, the directors are responsible for the management of the Company's
business, for which purpose they may exercise all the powers of the Company.
4 Shareholders' reserve power
@ The shareholders may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, or refrain from
taking, specified action.
@) No such special resolution invalidates anything which the directors have done before the
passing of the resolution.
5 Directors may delegate
@ Subject to the articles, the directors may delegate any of the powers which are conferred on
them under the articles:
@) to such person or committee;
(b) by such means (including by power of attorney);
© to such an extent;
(d) in relation to such matters or territories; and
(&) on such terms and conditions;
as they think fit.
@) If the directors so specify, any such delegation may authorise further delegation of the
directors' powers by any person to whom they are delegated.
3) The directors may revoke any delegation in whole or part, or alter its terms and conditions.
6 Committees
Committees to which the directors delegate any of their powers must follow procedures which
are based as far as they are applicable on those provisions of the articles which govern the
taking of decisions by directors. The directors may make rules of procedure for all or any
committees, which prevail over rules derived from the articles if they are not consistent with
them.
DECISION-MAKING BY DIRECTORS
7 Directors to take decisions collectively
@ The general rule about decision-making by directors is that any decision of the directors must
be either a majority decision at a meeting or a decision taken in accordance with article 8.
2) If:
@) the Company only has one director, and
(b) no provision of the articles requires it to have more than one director,
the general rule does not apply, and the director may, subject to articles 8(3) and 16 take
decisions without regard to any other of the provisions of the articles relating to directors'
decision-making.
8 Unanimous decisions
@ A decision of the directors is taken in accordance with this article when all eligible directors
indicate to each other by any means that they share a common view on a matter.
@) Such a decision may take the form of a resolution in writing, copies of which have been
signed by each eligible director or to which each eligible director has otherwise indicated
agreement in writing.
3) References in this article to eligible directors are to directors who would have been entitled to
vote on the matter had it been proposed as a resolution at a directors’ meeting.

@ A decision may not be taken in accordance with this article if the eligible directors would not
have formed a quorum at such a meeting.

9 Calling a directors' meeting

@ Any director may call a directors' meeting by giving notice of the meeting to the directors or by
authorising the Company secretary (if any) to give such notice.

@) Notice of any directors’ meeting must indicate:

@) its proposed date and time;

(b) where it is to take place; and

© if it is anticipated that directors participating in the meeting will not be in the same
place, how it is proposed that they should communicate with each other during the
meeting.

3) Notice of a directors' meeting must be given to each director, but need not be in writing.

@ Notice of a directors' meeting need not be given to directors who waive their entitlement to
notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the Company not more than 7 days
after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has
been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it.

10 Participation in directors' meetings

@ Subject to the articles, directors participate in a directors' meeting, or part of a directors'
meeting, when:

@) the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with the articles, and
(b) they can each communicate to the others any information or opinions they have on
any particular item of the business of the meeting.

@) In determining whether directors are participating in a directors' meeting, it is irrelevant where
any director is or how they communicate with each other.

3) If all the directors participating in a meeting are not in the same place, they may decide that
the meeting is to be treated as taking place wherever any of them is.

11 Quorum for directors' meetings

@ At a directors' meeting, unless a quorum is participating, no proposal is to be voted on, except
a proposal to call another meeting.

@) The quorum for directors' meetings may be fixed from time to time by a decision of the
directors, but it must never be less than two unless there is just a sole director in office, and
unless otherwise fixed it is two.

3) If the total number of directors for the time being is less than the quorum required, the
directors must not take any decision other than a decision:

@) to appoint further directors, or
(b) to call a general meeting so as to enable the shareholders to appoint further directors.
12 Chairing of directors' meetings

(1) The directors may appoint a director to chair their meetings.

@) The person so appointed for the time being is known as the chairman.

3) The directors may terminate the chairman's appointment at any time.

@ If the chairman is not participating in a directors' meeting within ten minutes of the time at
which it was to start, the participating directors must appoint one of themselves to chair it.

13 Casting vote

The chairman or other director chairing the meeting shall not, if the numbers of votes for and against a

proposal are equal, have a second or casting vote.

14 Conflicts of interest

@ If a proposed decision of the directors is concerned with an actual or proposed transaction or
arrangement with the Company in which a director is interested, that director is not to be
counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum or voting purposes.

@) But if paragraph (3) applies, a director who is interested in an actual or proposed transaction
or arrangement with the Company is to be counted as participating in the decision-making
process for quorum and voting purposes.

3) This paragraph applies when:

@) the Company by ordinary resolution disapplies the provision of the articles which
would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as participating in the
decision-making process;

(b) the director's interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict
of interest; or

© the director's conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause.

@ For the purposes of this article, the following are permitted causes:

@) a guarantee given, or to be given, by or to a director in respect of an obligation
incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;

(b) subscription, or an agreement to subscribe, for shares or other securities of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, or to underwrite, sub-underwrite, or guarantee
subscription for any such shares or securities; and

© arrangements pursuant to which benefits are made available to employees and
directors or former employees and directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
which do not provide special benefits for directors or former directors.

(5) For the purposes of this article, references to proposed decisions and decision-making
processes include any directors' meeting or part of a directors' meeting.

6) Subject to paragraph (7), if a question arises at a meeting of directors or of a committee of
directors as to the right of a director to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for
voting or quorum purposes, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be
referred to the chairman whose ruling in relation to any director other than the chairman is to
be final and conclusive.
@ If any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise
in respect of the chairman, the question is to be decided by a decision of the directors at that
meeting, for which purpose the chairman is not to be counted as participating in the meeting
(or that part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes.

8) Where the number of non-conflicted directors is less than the quorum for the purposes of
approving a resolution authorising any situation or transaction constituting a conflict as
anticipated by the Companies Acts, the quorum shall be all the disinterested directors.

9 When all the directors of the Company are conflicted, the Company shall pass the conflict to
the Company’s shareholders for approval by ordinary resolution.

15 Records of decisions to be kept
The directors must ensure that the Company keeps a record, in writing, for at least 10 years
from the date of the decision recorded of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the
directors.

take decisions, and about how such rules are to be recorded or communicated to directors.

it must be paid by reference to each shareholder's holding of shares on the date of the
resolution or decision to declare or pay it.

paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any
preferential dividend is in arrear.

that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.

(5) If the directors act in good faith, they do not incur any liability to the holders of shares
conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim
dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights.

recipient at his registered address (if the distribution recipient is a holder of the
share), or (in any other case) to an address specified by the distribution recipient
either in writing or as the directors may otherwise decide; or

© any other means of payment as the directors agree with the distribution recipient
either in writing or by such other means as the directors decide.

(b) if the share has two or more joint holders, whichever of them is named first in the

otherwise by operation of law, the transmittee.

share unless otherwise provided by the terms on which the share was issued, or the

provisions of another agreement between the holder of that share and the Company.

34 Unclaimed distributions

(1) All dividends or other sums which are payable in respect of shares and unclaimed after
having been declared or become payable, may be invested or otherwise made use of by the
directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed.

Company a trustee in respect of it and if

(@) twelve years have passed from the date on which a dividend or other sum became
due for payment; and

(b) the distribution recipient has not claimed it,

the distribution recipient is no longer entitled to that dividend or other sum and it ceases to

remain owing by the Company.

35 Non-cash distributions

@ Subject to the terms of issue of the share in question, the Company may, by ordinary
resolution on the recommendation of the directors, decide to pay all or part of a dividend or
other distribution payable in respect of a share by transferring non-cash assets of equivalent
value (including, without limitation, shares or other securities in any company).

@) For the purposes of paying a hon-cash distribution, the directors may make whatever
arrangements they think fit, including, where any difficulty arises regarding the distribution:

@) fixing the value of any assets;
(b) paying cash to any distribution recipient on the basis of that value in order to adjust
the rights of recipients; and

© vesting any assets in trustees.

36 Waiver of distributions

@ Distribution recipients may waive their entitlement to a dividend or other distribution payable
in respect of a share by giving the Company notice in writing to that effect, but if:

@) the share has more than one holder, or

(b) more than one person is entitled to the share, whether by reason of the death or
bankruptcy of one or more joint holders, or otherwise,

the notice is not effective unless it is expressed to be given, and signed, by all the holders or

persons otherwise entitled to the share.

37 Authority to capitalise and appropriation of capitalised sums

@ The directors may, if they are so authorised by an ordinary resolution:

@) decide to capitalise any profits of the Company (whether or not they are available for
distribution) which are not required for paying a preferential dividend, or any sum
standing to the credit of the Company’s share premium account or capital redemption
reserve; and

(b) appropriate any sum which they so decide to capitalise (a "capitalised sum") to the
persons who would have been entitled to it if it were distributed by way of dividend
(the "persons entitled") and in the same proportions.

@) Capitalised sums must be applied:

@) on behalf of the persons entitled, and

(b) in the same proportions as a dividend would have been distributed to them.

3) Any capitalised sum may be applied in paying up new shares of a nominal amount equal to

@) apply capitalised sums in accordance with paragraphs (3) and (4) above partly in one
way and partly in another;
